### About Me

I go to UMD as a CS major and Stats minor (might do Math double major instead though). Mostly interested in SWE and ML but have been poking around with developer tooling and libraries too.

### What I'm Currently Up To

- Working out for fun
- Cooking food for fun
- Building random stuff for fun
- Getting ready to get cooked by coursework again next semester
